In EMF a proxy is described by a [URI]({{site.src.emf}}/plugins/org.eclipse.emf.common/src/org/eclipse/emf/common/util/URI.java), which points to the real [EObject]({{site.src.emf}}/plugins/org.eclipse.emf.ecore/src/org/eclipse/emf/ecore/EObject.java).

The latter usually corresponds to the name of the referenced EObject. In EMF a URI consists of information about the resource the EObject is contained in as well as a so called fragment part, which is used to find the EObject within that resource.
