"The web integration of Xtext supports two operation modes, which are described"
" in the following."
msgstr ""

msgid "#### Stateful mode"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This mode is active when `sendFullText` is `false`, which is the default setti"
"ng. In stateful mode, an update request is sent to the server whenever the tex"
"t content of the editor changes. With this approach a copy of the text is kept"
" in the session state of the server, and many Xtext-related services such as A"
"ST parsing and validation are cached together with that copy. This means that "
"services run much faster on the server, and the message size of most requests "
"is very small. Use this mode in order to optimize response times of service re"
"quests."
msgstr ""

msgid "#### Stateless mode"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This mode is active when `sendFullText` is set to `true`. In this case no upda"
"te request is necessary when the text content changes, but the full text conte"
"nt is attached to all other service requests. This means that the text has to "
"be parsed again for each request, and the message size is proportional to the "
"size of the text content. Use this mode only when you want to avoid server-sid"
"e sessions and respective session ids stored in cookies."
msgstr ""

msgid "### Syntax Highlighting {#syntax-highlighting}"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In contrast to [semantic highlighting](#semantic-highlighting), syntax highlig"
"hting can be computed purely in JavaScript without requiring a connection to t"
"he server. This is realized with the highlighting capabilities of the employed"
" editor libraries. All three libraries offer a JavaScript API for specifying h"
"ighlighting rules. The `WebIntegrationFragment` of the Xtext language generato"
"r is able to generate a highlighting specification that includes keywords and "
"some basic tokens such as numbers and comments (see [The Language Generator](3"
"02_configuration.html#generator)). If the highlighting generated in this way i"
"s not sufficient, you can still implement the specification yourself following"
" the documentation of the chosen editor library."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The path to the highlighting specification is set with the `syntaxDefinition` "
"option while setting up the Xtext editor. If no value is specified for that op"
"tion, it is built from the `xtextLang` option in the form `'xtext-resources/{x"
"textLang}-syntax'` (Orion) or `'xtext-resources/mode-{xtextLang}'` (Ace). For "
"CodeMirror syntax highlighting is configured by registering a _mode_ and setti"
"ng the `mode` option accordingly (default mode name: `'xtext/{xtextLang}'`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "### Invoking Services"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `createEditor` and `createServices` functions set up listeners for editor "
"events such that most services are invoked automatically while using the edito"
"r. However, all services can also be invoked programmatically using the `xtext"
"Services` object that is attached to each editor instance. For example, the fo"
"llowing code saves the resource associated with the editor when the button wit"
"h the id `save-button` is clicked:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```javascript\n"
"var editor = xtext.createEditor();\n"
"$(\"#save-button\").click(function() {\n"

"});\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following functions are available, provided that the respective services a"
"re enabled and supported by the employed editor library. All functions return "
"a _promise_ that is eventually resolved to the requested data. Furthermore, al"
"l these functions can be supplied with an `options` parameter to override some"
" of the options declared when the editor was built."
