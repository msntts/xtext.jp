msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Parsing simple XML-like, structural languages with Xtext is a no-brainer. Howe"
"ver, parsing nested expressions is often considered complicated. This is the p"
"erception due to their recursive nature and the properties of the parser techn"
"ology used by Xtext. You have to avoid left recursive parser rules. As the und"
"erlying Antlr parser uses a top-down approach it would recurse endlessly if yo"
"u had a left recursive grammar."
msgstr ""

msgid "Let's have a look at parsing a simple arithmetic expression:"
msgstr ""

msgid "`2 + 20 * 2`"

msgid ""
"If you know EBNF a bit and wouldn't think about avoiding left recursion, opera"
"tor precedence or associativity, you'ld probably write a grammar like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```xtext\n"
"Expression :\n"
"  Expression '+' Expression |\n"
"  Expression '*' Expression |\n"
"  INT;\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This grammar would be left recursive because the parser reads the grammar top "
"down and left to right and would endlessly call the *Expression* rule without "
"consuming any characters, i.e. altering the underlying state of the parser. Wh"
"ile this kind of grammar can be written for bottom-up parsers, you would still"
" have to deal with operator precedence in addition. That is define that a mult"
"iplication has higher precedence than an addition for example."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Xtext you define the precedence implicitly when left-factoring such a gramm"
"ar. Left-factoring means you get rid of left recursion by applying a certain i"
"diom, which is described in the following."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As you can see the main difference is that it uses three rules instead of one,"
" and if you look a bit closer you see that there's a certain delegation patter"
"n involved. The rule *Addition* doesn't call itself but calls *Multiplication*"
" instead. The operator precedence is defined by the order of delegation. The l"
"ater the rule is called the higher is its precedence. This is at least the cas"
"e for the first two rules which are of a left recursive nature (but we've left"
"-factored them now). The last rule is not left recursive which is why you can "
"implement it without applying this pattern."
msgstr ""

msgid ""

"le with the next higher precedence."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now that left recursion is avoided, the parser should produce a proper syntax "
"tree. In Xtext each rule returns a value. Production rules return AST nodes (i"

" as well as terminal rules return simple values like strings. Xtext can automa"
"tically infer whether some rule is a production rule, i.e. constructs and retu"
"rns an AST node, or if it is a data type rule that returns a value. The gramma"
"r above only consists of data type rules all of them returning plain strings. "
"In order to construct an AST we need to add assignments and actions to the gra"
"mmar."

" current rule was already created. Otherwise it will create one based on the r"
